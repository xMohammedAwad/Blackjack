a simple Blackjack game. The game has a deck of cards, which are drawn randomly.
It includes a start button to begin the game, a reset button to restart the
game, a button to draw a new card, and a button to stand. The game keeps track
of the player's and dealer's card decks, their total points, and who the winner
is. The code uses event listeners to initiate actions when a button is clicked,
and it also includes a function to check the winner based on the points. The
game is rendered using DOM manipulation, which displays the message and cards on
the screen.
